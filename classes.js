Question 4
There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

    C = (F - 32) / 1.8 F = 1.8 * C + 32 K = C + 273

a.Make an object called freezingPoint that has three properties: celsius, fahrenheit, and kelvin.Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.*/

/* b.Make a class called Celsius that has one property: celsius, and two methods getFahrenheitTemp, and getKelvinTemp.

let outsideTempt = new Celsius(10.0)
outsideTempt.celsius //returns 10.0
outsideTempt.getKelvinTemp() //returns 283.0
outsideTempt.getFahrenheitTemp() //returns 50.0

c.Give Celsius a method called isBelowFreezing that returns a Bool(true
    if the temperature is below freezing). */

/*Question 5
a.Create a class called Movie that has properties
for name, year, genre, cast, and description.Create an instance of your Movie

b.Create an method inside Movie called blurb that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."*/

/*Question 6
Write a class Vector that represents a vector in two - dimensional space.It takes two number arguments: x and y parameters, which it should be saved to properties of the same name.

Give the Vector prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another vector as an argument and returns a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectorsâ€™(the one in this and the parameter) x and y values.

Add a method getLength to the prototype that computes the length of the vector;
that is, the distance of the point(x, y) from the origin(0, 0).(a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 2)

var v1 = new Vector(1, 2)
var v2 = new Vector(2, 3)
console.log(v1.plus(v2));
// => Vector {x: 3, y: 5}
console.log(v1.minus(v2));

var v3 = new Vector(3, 4)
console.log(v3.getLength());

a.Write a class called Cylinder that has properties radius and height.Create an instance of a Cylinder.

b.Add an instance method getVolume that returns the volume

c.Add an instance method getSurfaceArea that returns the surface area. */

/*Question 8
Dates in JavaScript

b.Create an instance method that returns whether or not the post was made today.
c.Filter your array of Post objects to only include posts made today. */

/* Question 9
a.Make a class called Car with properties make and model.Create an instance of a Car
b.Make a class called Bike with properties gears and hasBell.Create an instance of Bike
c.Give each class a static method called numberOfWheels that returns the number of wheels(2 for bikes, 4 for cars).Why does it make sense for this to be a static method instead of an instance method ? */

/*Question 10
a.Make a class called Vehicle with properties color and name.Give it a method called makeSound which logs "WHHOOSSSH" to the console
b.Modify your Car and Bike classes from Question 7 to extend the Vehicle class.
c.Create a new Bike instance that has a color of "green"
and name "Bikey McBikeface"
d.Create a new Car instance that has a color of "red" and name "Carry McCarface." */
